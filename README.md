I'm Tommy from Sydney, Australia, and I am currently studying Bachelor of Advanced Computing at the University of Sydney. Over the past two years, I have developed a passion for programming. Through learning to code, I have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of programmers and how we positively impact the broader community. I am proud to be a part of this community and hope to further develop my skills to be more involved in the wonderful world that programming offers.

Skills: Python / C / HTML / CSS / Webflow / Wordpress / Java / SQL

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a programmer.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python, Java, SQL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anyone who loves to program 

To see the learning I have done, please view my repository where I showcase everything that I have been learning to become a better programmer.
